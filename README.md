## Overview

**Currently only Bo2 Demos have been added, and we're working on uploading more games soon.** As I add more demos, the archive will update on your version as well, eliminating the need to re-download.

## Search Filters

Use the following search filters to refine your results:

- **weapon or w**
- **camo or c**
- **attachment or a**
- **map or m**
- **kills or k** (number of kills in demo)
- **tags or t** (there's a list of these if you click statistics in the top right corner) e.g. explosion, js, ns
- **player or p**

## Example Query

_Make sure you have a space between search filters and no space after the colon._

Example query: `weapon:dsr map:nuketown player:fax tags:rel kills:4`
